My name is Abiola Ajbola, I am a JavaScript developer.

I love solving problems and I love coding too, so you could say I love solving problems with code ðŸ˜‰.

- I am currently occupied with building user-facing web applications. (So I care about accessibility and great UI/UX ðŸ˜Š).
- I am focussed on building great experiences for my users with React (including Gatsby and Next.js), but I some of the other tools I use include:
  - Node.js (and Express)
  - MongoDB
  - PostgreSQL
  - MySQL
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Vanilla JavaScript
  - TypeScript
- I am always learning a new thing or the other, protocol buffers, vector tiles and leaflet.js are some of the tools I have learnt more recently. I also have my eyes on Web3, but I am staying on the fringes for now.
- I am open for collaboration on open source web apps.
